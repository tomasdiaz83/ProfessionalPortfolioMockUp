Professional Portfolio Mockup for Week 2 Project

## Description

A portfolio mockup exhibiting my beginning skills with HTML and CSS. I endeavored to implement a simple layout, with a header navigation and animations on my project cards. Difficulties most arose in trying to make images responsive, a problem that I fixed more or less with duct tape and need to continue working on.
